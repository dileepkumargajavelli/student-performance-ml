# Student Performance Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts student overall scores using Random Forest Regression.

## 📌 Problem Statement
Predict student academic performance based on study habits and subject scores.

## ⚙️ Steps Performed
- Downloaded dataset from Kaggle
- Data preprocessing using Pandas
- Selected important features
- Train/Test split
- Model training using Random Forest
- Evaluation using MAE and R²
- Feature importance analysis

## 📊 Results
MAE ≈ 2.2 marks  
R² ≈ 0.97  

Study hours had the highest impact on student performance.
